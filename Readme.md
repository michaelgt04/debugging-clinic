# Debugging Clinic

## Learning to Debug

This is the Ruby code my from clinic today! You should be able to go in and add
your own features to be able to begin building your debugging skills. It's important to remember
that you need to develop your own debugging style! There's not really a right or 
wrong way to go about debugging something. Keep experimenting, keep trying and
you'll develop your skills before you know it.

Here are a few tips for developing your own debugging techniques:

* Throw `pry`s everywhere!

	There's not a wrong place to put a debugger! This is the same for your
	debuggers in Javascript as well! If you're at all confused about the code
	you're working with or what the values of your variables are, that's a 
	good place to use a debugger.

* Use `pry` to experiment with commands
	
	If you're not sure about the way to call your variables or use your methods,
	experiment with different versions in a pry session. This is super effective
	because instead of having to reload your code to try different iterations, you
	can try things out in pry to figure out what works.

* This style applies in Javascript!

	You're learning the debugging skill, it's not only applicable in Ruby. Your 
	debuggers might be a little different (`debugger` and `console.log`) but the
	same principles and skill still apply! This can be especially useful given that
	Javascript can be more difficult to read than Ruby.

### Experiment!

There's no wrong way to do this! Debugging is not only a way to get your code
working, it's also an invaluable way to learn more about how your code is working.
Use it to explore around and see how things work! It's an invaluable tool to 
continue learning about your code!
